Python 3.7 

Instructions:

Need to have pulled the cache_encryptedB.db from an iOS device. Make sure that the script and the database are in the same folder and just launch the script. Within this .db there are several tables that hold location data which is why I created this. 

This script is able to pull the location data from the following tables CellLocation, LteCellLocation, LteCellLocationLocal, and WifiLocation. 

There are two posted scripts one S@n_cache_encryptedB.py that just contains the timestamp, latitude, and longitude which makes it easier to import into google earth. 

The other S@n_cache_encryptedB_all.py that pulls all columns from within the tables. 

To import this into google earth just launch google earth and goto file/import and point it to the pulled csv files. 


Work in progress: 

I am working on getting the data to populate within google maps to view data/time stamps.
